# Shipment API

## Installation
1. Unzip the file "shipment-list". Or you can clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:glauber-silva/shipment-list.git`.
2. `cd` into `shipment-list`: `cd shipment-list`.
3. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv#installation).
4. Install [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv#installation).
5. Install Python 3.5.1: `pyenv install 3.6.0`.
6. Create a new virtualenv called "shipment-list": `pyenv virtualenv 3.5.1 shipment-list`.
7. Set the local virtualenv to "shipment-list": `pyenv local shipment-list`.
8. Reload the `pyenv` environment: `pyenv rehash`.

If all went well then your command line prompt should now start with `(shipment-list)`.

If your command line prompt does not start with `(shipment-list)` at this point, try running `pyenv activate shipment-list` or `cd ../shipment-list`. 

If pyenv is still not working, mail to [Glauber](mailto:glauber.lucio.silva@gmail.com) so I can help you out.
